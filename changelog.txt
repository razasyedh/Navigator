0.7 - Initial working app. The Wavefront Implementation is pretty slow.
1.0 - The pathfinding algorithm is much faster thanks to a bugfix for
      duplicate nodes being queued.
1.2 - Navigator now updates paths on the fly. Colors have also been redone so
      they won't bleed after a certain limit. Lastly, the UI has been a little
      simplified.
1.5 - The app is now entirely mouse-controlled for a simplified user
      experience. A bug causing the cursor to not change after errors has also
      been fixed.
